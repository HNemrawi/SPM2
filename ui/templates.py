**SPM2 Analysis Overview**  
*Assessing housing stability by tracking if and when clients return to homeless services after exiting to permanent housing.*

---

### 1. Client Universe  
- **Included Project Types**  
- Street Outreach (SO)  
- Emergency Shelter (ES)  
- Transitional Housing (TH)  
- Safe Haven (SH)  
- Permanent Housing (PH)  
- **Date Window**  
- Consider exits that occurred **within 730 days before** the reporting period  
    - Exit Date ‚â• (Report Start Date ‚Äì 730 days)  
    - Exit Date ‚â§ (Report End Date ‚Äì 730 days)

---

### 2. Identifying the "Permanent Housing" Exit  
- **Definition:** the client's **earliest** exit into any PH project  
- **Tie‚ÄëBreaker:** if multiple exits share that date, pick the one with **lowest Enrollment ID**

---

### 3. Scanning for a Return to Homeless Services  
1. **Search Window:** from the PH exit date up to the end of the reporting period  
2. **Eligible Return Enrollments:**  
- Any SO, ES, TH, or SH project  
- PH project re‚Äëentries that meet both:  
    - Start date **> 14 days** after the original PH exit  
    - No overlap with **another PH transition window**  
    - Transition window = Day 1 after PH start through `min(PH exit + 14 days, report end)`  
3. **First Qualifying Return:**  
- Project Start ‚â• PH Exit Date  
- Project Start ‚â§ Report End Date  
- Stop at the very first enrollment that fulfills the above

---

### 4. Classifying Return Timing  
| Category         | Days from Exit       |  
|------------------|----------------------|  
| **< 6 months**   | 0‚Äì180 days           |  
| **6‚Äì12 months**  | 181‚Äì365 days         |  
| **12‚Äì24 months** | 366‚Äì730 days         |  
| **> 24 months**  | 731+ days            |

---

### 5. Interpretation Guide  
- **Return Rate**  
- Percentage of clients who re‚Äëenroll in any homeless service after exiting to PH  
- **Timing Distribution**  
- How long (in days) it takes for clients to return, broken down by the categories above  
- **Trajectory Flows**  
- Sankey or flow diagrams showing client pathways from exit through return (if any)

**Inbound Recidivism Analysis Overview**  
*Evaluate client returns to homelessness programs after prior exits.*  

### Key Features:
- **Configurable Lookback Window:** Choose how many days before entry to search for exits.
- **First-Entry Selection:** Takes each client's first entry between *report_start* and *report_end*.
- **Flexible Filters:** Apply CoC, local CoC, agency, program, and project-type filters separately on entries and exits.
- **Return Classification:**
  - üÜï **New Clients:** No exit found within the lookback window.
  - üîÑ **Returning Clients:** Last exit within lookback, but not to permanent housing.
  - üè† **Returning from Housing:** Last exit destination was `Permanent Housing Situations`.
- **Interactive Visuals:** Metrics cards, time‚Äëto‚Äëentry box plots, flow matrices, and Sankey diagrams.

### Methodology Highlights:
1. **Entry Identification:** Filtered by date range, then deduplicated to first entry per client.  
2. **Exit Lookup:** For each entry, find the **single most recent** exit within *lookback_days*.  
3. **Classification Logic:**  
   - *New* if no qualifying exit  
   - *Returning From Housing* if exit's destination == `Permanent Housing Situations`  
   - *Returning* otherwise  

**Interpretation Guide:**
- **Metrics:** Counts & percentages for *New*, *Returning*, and *Returning from Housing*.  
- **Timing Analysis:** Box plots show distribution of days between exit and entry.  
- **Flow Analysis:** Matrices & Sankey diagrams visualize exit‚Üíentry paths.

### How This Analysis Works

1. **Which Exits Are Included?**  
   You configure filters (CoC, Agency, Program, Project Type, Destination Category, etc.) and a reporting date range.  
   For each client, only their **last exit** enrollment (matching filters and within the date window) is analyzed.

2. **Return Definitions**  
   - **Return** = first enrollment after the exit (any project type).  
   - **Return to Homelessness** = first **qualifying** enrollment after exit, defined as:  
     1. Exclude any project where `ProjectTypeCode` is a non-homeless project type.
     2. **Skip** any PH enrollment where `ProjectStart == HouseholdMoveInDate`.  
     3. For PH enrollments:  
        - If gap ‚â§ 14 days, build an **exclusion window** (from day +1 after start to exit +14 days).  
        - Also skip any future PH entry falling within any exclusion window.  
        - Otherwise, that PH entry **qualifies** as a return from Permanent Housing.
     4. Any non-PH enrollment (after those filters) qualifies immediately.  

   *Note:* "Return to Homelessness" rates are computed **only** for exits to Permanent Housing.

3. **Key Output Metrics**  
   - **# Exits Analyzed:** count of last exits matching your filters.  
   - **# Exits to PH:** count where `ExitDestinationCat == "Permanent Housing Situations"`.  
   - **Return & % Return:** # and share of exits with any subsequent enrollment.  
   - **Return to Homelessness (PH) & %:** among PH exits, # and share meeting the above "Return to Homelessness" criteria.  
   - **Timing Metrics:** median/average/max days between exit and qualifying return.

4. **PH vs. Non-PH Comparison**  
   Side-by-side metrics for exits to Permanent Housing vs. all other exits.  
   PH-specific "Return to Homelessness" metrics are shown only for the PH subset.
